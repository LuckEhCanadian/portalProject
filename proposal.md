# Portal Proposal

## Description
I am looking to continue my grid based assignment to make a grid based top down portal game. Most of the base fucntionality is done but more content needs to be added. I'm looking to add boxes and more chambers among other things. 

## Need to have list
- Functional portals
- Walls
- Buttons
- Doors
- Multiple chambers
- Some level of legitimate difficulty
- GLaDOS voice lines somewhere in there

## Nice to have
- Boxes
- Pressure plates that need boxes to activate
- A menu
- Win screen including cake
- Turets that will shoot if you're in thier line of sight
- Portals that don't go through walls
- Portals that only spawn on walls
- Lazers
- Lazer redirection cubes
- Smoother movement
- Some more random stuff i'm probably not going to be able to make opperational
