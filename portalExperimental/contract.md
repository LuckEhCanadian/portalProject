With this agreement, You (the player) agrees to perform services for Aperture Laboratories for the project tentatively titled 'Aperture Experiments' on the following terms and conditions.

Aperture Laboratories needs to approve the work resulting from You (the player)'s services before it is considered complete. Aperture Laboratories will therefore try to continuously and clearly communicate what makes the work complete and will try to approve or disapprove the work resulting from the services as soon as possible. You (the player) is aware that minor adjustments and fixes to the work are also part of the services.

The deadline for You (the player) to complete the services is Decebuary 1st 4050. Together, Aperture Laboratories and You (the player) can agree to set a new deadline or redefine the services to be performed for the existing deadline. When You (the player) becomes aware that You (the player) is unable to complete the services on the deadline, You (the player) will immediately notify Aperture Laboratories. If You (the player) is unable to complete the services on the deadline and Aperture Laboratories and You (the player) cannot agree on a new deadline, Aperture Laboratories can decide to no longer use You (the player)â€™s services.

If Aperture Laboratories does not pay on time, You (the player) can delay deadlines with as many days as Aperture Laboratories delays the owed payment. If Aperture Laboratories wants You (the player) to perform services that are not listed above, Aperture Laboratories and You (the player) can agree to add services to this agreement or sign a new agreement.

# Compensation
After Aperture Laboratories has approved the work delivered by You (the player), Aperture Laboratories agrees to pay You (the player) $000,000,000CAD on Decebuary 1st 4050.

All amounts in this agreement are excluding VAT (value added tax). You (the player) will send invoices to receive payment(s) from Aperture Laboratories, after which Aperture Laboratories will make payment In Cash within 30 days of receiving an invoice. You (the player) will be responsible for all expenses made while performing the services under this agreement. Because You (the player) is not an employee of Aperture Laboratories, You (the player) is not entitled to worker's compensation, retirement, insurance or other benefits afforded to employees of Aperture Laboratories.

# Rights to the work
You (the player) fully transfers all rights to the work resulting from the services to Aperture Laboratories, including art, images, designs, audio, videos, code, typography, and text as well as all test results and findindings throughout your time in the lab. If the law applicable to this agreement does not allow for the transfer of rights to the work, then You (the player) gives Aperture Laboratories the exclusive worldwide right to use the work, not limited in time and for every distribution platform. Without permission from You (the player) and without paying additional compensation to You (the player), Aperture Laboratories can distribute the work, make changes to the work, base other works on it, give and transfer rights to others, all as part of Aperture Science or as part of something else.

You (the player) will make sure that Aperture Laboratories can make full use of the work, which means that You (the player) will only deliver work that You (the player) made, or work from others if it comes with a license that allows the work to be included in Aperture Science. If You (the player) delivers work to Aperture Laboratories that is claimed to infringe the rights of others, then You (the player) will defend Aperture Laboratories against these claims, and You (the player) is responsible for all damages Aperture Laboratories may suffer.

Aperture Laboratories agrees to credit You (the player) in- and outside of Aperture Science following the industry standard. You (the player) can showcase the work resulting from the services for You (the player)'s portfolio, but if Aperture Science is still unreleased, You (the player) needs written permission from Aperture Laboratories.

# Confidential information
You (the player) agrees not to disclose or use any confidential information of Aperture Laboratories or Aperture Science without Aperture Laboratories's written permission, both during and after the term of this agreement. Confidential information is defined as information that Aperture Laboratories has not made public.

# In case of a disagreement
Both Aperture Laboratories and You (the player) cannot end the agreement without a good reason. In case of a disagreement, Aperture Laboratories and You (the player) will do their best to respectfully resolve the disagreement. If Aperture Laboratories and You (the player) cannot find a solution for their disagreement, and Aperture Laboratories or You (the player) wants to end the agreement, they need to give a seven day deadline to get to a solution.

If Aperture Laboratories and You (the player) did their best to resolve the disagreement during these seven days but could not come to a solution, this agreement can be ended, and any rights that Aperture Laboratories already paid for before the disagreement stay with Aperture Laboratories. Aperture Laboratories and You (the player) can come to an additional agreement about rights that Aperture Laboratories has not yet paid for.

In case of a lasting conflict and Aperture Laboratories and You (the player) want to use arbitration or go to court, they can only do that in (REDACTED),(REDACTED) using the laws of (REDACTED),(REDACTED).

# Signatures
Aperture Laboratories and You (the player) have both signed every page of this agreement, and each have their own copy of the signed agreement for future reference. This agreement starts on the latest date that Aperture Laboratories or You (the player) signs.
