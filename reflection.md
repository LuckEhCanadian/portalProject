#REFLECTION

##CONFIDENTIAL

##Biggest challenge
the biggest challenger throughout my project was more to do with not wanting to go back and change thisngs that were backwards or did't quite work the way i wanted them too then javascript not having a way to make what i wanted to do. That leads into my biggest regret of not going back early and fixing the backwards x-y stuff which would have saved me a lot of headache and frustration. I am pretty happy with how the entire thing turned out with a few expections that were a lot of patchwork things and the broken x-y thing. If i were to go back and do all of this again I would definetly fix those major things that plagued me all the way through.

##did i get everything?
i got all my need to have things done. for my nice to have i missed a few thing but mos of them ended up getting turned into other things. for example, the turrets in the nice to have turned into the lazers. the code for thgem was so similar that i ended up just scrapping them all together and that was that. other then taht pretty much everything got done besides and ending that i might have time for this period
