#REFLECTION

##Biggest challenge
the biggest challenger throughout my project was more to do with not wanting to go back and change thisngs that were backwards or did't quite work the way i wanted them too then javascript not having a way to make what i wanted to do. That leads into my biggest regret of not going back early and fixing the backwards x-y stuff which would have saved me a lot of headache and frustration. I am pretty happy with how the entire thing turned out with a few expections that were a lot of patchwork things and the broken x-y thing.
